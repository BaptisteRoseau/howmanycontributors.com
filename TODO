# TODO

Backend, for a given URL

- [ ] Make sure the URL follows: http[s]://github.com/OWNER/REPO

- [ ] Use scrapper to parse the URL's HTML: <https://docs.rs/scraper/0.19.0/scraper/> (Respect the rate limit)
- [ ] Search for "Contributors" and optionally "Used by" in the HTML
- [ ] Cache results in a key/value Redis for 3 days + rand(1day) with: [OWNER/REPO, contributors, used_by]
- [ ] Search for dependencies at $URL/network/dependencies
- [ ] Repeat for each dependencies
